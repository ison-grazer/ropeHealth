# ropeHealth
An app for keeping track of the usage of your climbing ropes, making it easier to decide when to retire one.

Created using Xcode in Swift.

Current state:
Initial view is up and running with two segues to "Register new rope" and to "Updare rope" and accepting user input. 
Currently working on implementing CoreData, making it possible for the user to store and fetch registered ropes.

In the future:
Improve design and UI.
Letting the user look at graphs of all entries.
